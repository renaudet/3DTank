A 3D-printed, WiFi-controlled, Raspberry PI powered,  tracked vehicule

Hello there,

I'm happy to publish my work to create a tracked vehicule powered by a Raspberry PI3 B+ with two NEMA 17 Stepper motors

![General view](https://github.com/renaudet/3DTank/blob/main/Screenshots/Tank3D_v1.0.png?raw=true)

All the STL files for this tracked vehicule are provided as-is and may be printed on any entry-level 3D printer.
I personaly use a Vyper from Anycubic and green PLA filament from dailyfill.

To build the vehicule you will need some extra parts:

- 10 mm screws (dozens of them)
- about 3 meters iron filament
- 1 Raspberry PI 3 B+ board plus SD card
- 1 Waveshare Stepper Motor Hat
- 2 NEMA 17 Stepper motors
- 1 11.2V 2200 MAh LiPo battery
- 1 5MP FishEye camera for Raspberry PI
